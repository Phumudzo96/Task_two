# Task_two

This program will be used to calculate the area that the foundation of a
building covers. This program should:

○ Ask the user to enter the shape of the building (square, rectangular
or round).

○ Based on the user’s input, prompt for the appropriate dimensions.
See what dimensions you need in the list of formulae below.

○ Calculate and display the area that will be taken up by the
foundation of the building.

Formulae for area:

○ Area of square = length of the square to the power of two (length
).
○ Area of rectangle = length x width.

○ Area of circle = pi X radius squared (𝛱radius2)
